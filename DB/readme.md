## WHY?
You may ask me why do I use some scripts to generate mongoose schema from .yaml .



This is a test for another project called *ProjectBoost*.
It's purpose to create all boilerplate code from data structre.
So these yaml files will probably be used **for generating GraphQL schemas**

Direction of further devel:

Dir structure is like:

Name

	L_ schema.yaml

	L_ client.coffee #api for web

	L_ server.coffee #functions of server

	L_ Schema.js

	L_ GraphQL.js

	L_ desc.md
