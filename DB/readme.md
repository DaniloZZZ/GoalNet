## WHY?
You may ask me why do I use some scripts to generate mongoose schema from .yaml .



This is a test for another project called *ProjectBoost*.
It's purpose to create all boilerplate code from data structre.
So these yaml files will probably be used **for generating GraphQL schemas**

Direction of further devel:

Dir structure is like:

	Name
	├── client.coffee #api for web
	├── server.coffee #functions of server
	├── Schema.js
	├── GraphQL.js
	└── desc.md
